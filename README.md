This is a website  accessibility project
The prupose of this project is to make the website accessible. Below listed are some of the ways this can benefit potential users.
Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can:

perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web
contribute to the Web
Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, including:

auditory
cognitive
neurological
physical
speech
visual
Web accessibility also benefits people without disabilities, for example:

people using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens, different input modes, etc.
older people with changing abilities due to ageing
people with “temporary disabilities” such as a broken arm or lost glasses
people with “situational limitations” such as in bright sunlight or in an environment where they cannot listen to audio
people using a slow Internet connection, or who have limited or expensive bandwidth. 

There were errors that effected various areas of accessibility. 
Alt text for images provide visually impaired or challenged site visitors to use assistive technologies like screen readers to read the content in a logical flow, making it a seamless experience.
A document area was not labelled making navigation difficult for visually challenged and cognitively challenged site visitors to make logical sense of the flow of website content.
Inlinking did not have a target thereby making it hard for Crawlers to crawl the pages and would affect the on page SEO.
Color contrast for the sidebar was not optimised for readability and accessibility thereby making it hard to decipher for people with challenged vision or color blindness. Optimised for accessibility.
